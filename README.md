Python Project for a version of the "Shut the Box" game based on the following rules:

GAME OBJECTIVE:
Roll the dice to lay down all the numbered tiles and “shut the box,” or be the player with the lowest score. 
NUMBER OF PLAYERS: Any number of players may play Shut-the-Box; the more players, the more exciting the action! 

To start the game, turn the tiles up so the numbers are displayed. 
A round of play consists of each player taking one turn. 
The first player rolls the dice within the felt-lined box and lays down any combination of tiles that matches his or her roll. 
Any die that leaves the playing field or leans at an angle against the inside of the box, requires a re-roll. 

FOR EXAMPLE: If you roll a 5 and 3, you may lay down any combination of tiles that add up to 8. 
You may lay down the 8 tile; 
the 5 and 3 tiles; 
he 6 and 2 tiles; 
the 7 and 1 tiles; 
the 5, 2, and 1 tiles; 
or the 4, 3, and 1 tiles. 

Continue rolling and laying down tiles. 
If the remaining tiles add up to 6 or less, roll a single die. 

When you can no longer lay down any tiles, your turn is over and you determine your score. 
If you lay down all of the tiles, you’ve shut the box and your score is zero! 

Remember, lower scores are better. 

SCORING EXAMPLE: 
You’ve rolled the dice and you have no tiles left to turn down that equal the sum of the dice. 
Your turn is over and you read the remaining tiles from left to right to determine your score. 
If the 1, 4, 7, 8, and 9 tiles remain up, your score is 14,789. 
After determining your score, pass the dice to the next player. 
Each player takes a turn trying to beat the previous score until the person with the lowest score after one round wins.
